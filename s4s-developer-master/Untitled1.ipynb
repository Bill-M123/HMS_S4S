    "# Participant Web App\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains all the code for a simple Django based app for adding potential patients to a database.  There are four screens that the user has access to within the app:  Login, Landing Page, List Existing Participants, Add new Participant, and Logout.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The app builds a small sqlite database having the following fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Participant Name (text, max len=20)\n",
    "- Participant Age (text, max len=20)\n",
    "- Does Participant have any siblings? (text, max len=20, currently limited to Y/N)\n",
    "- Known environmental exposures (text, max len=20, limited to Pb,SS (2nd hand smoke), and NA)\n",
    "- Known genetic mutations (text, max len=20, limited to MM (Missense),NS (Nonsense), and NA)\n",
    "\n",
    "The choices for exposure and mutation type are limited for demonstration purposes, but easily extensible.  The siblings field was implemented as a text field so that future implementations could contain more information than a simple Y/N on sibling existence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation and Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by cloning this directory:  https://github.com/Bill-M123/HMS_S4S/tree/master/hms\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open a command line. Navigate to ~\\hms_coding\\hms.  In this directory, you should see a file named: manage.py\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create a conda environment (see note below if you need help):  __conda create --name _myenv_ --file requirements.txt__ where __myenv__ is the name of your conda environment, and __requirements.txt__ is as described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Activate conda environment: __conda activate myenv__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start the django development server:  __python manage.py runserver__\n",
    "\n",
    "- Open a fresh browser, type http://127.0.0.1:8000/web_ap/\n",
    "\n",
    "- Login (credentials available elsewhere)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Note__\n",
    "\n",
    "App was built in an python 3.7 environment from Anaconda.  Anaconda is available here:  https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual conda env requirements can be found at: \\hms\\requirements.txt.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This environment is very heavy and would also be suitable for basic data science (including Question 1 of this test) but any recent version of Python(3.7) with django (2.2.1 or later), re, os, and path should work (though is untested at this point due to time constraints.)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Style Notes:__  App roughly styled based on:  http://syncfor.science/"
